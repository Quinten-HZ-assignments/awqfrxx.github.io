            <!--<p>My name is Quinten van Hoegee. I'm 22 years old and I currently live in Middelburg. <br/>
            I've got my own appartment which is awesome! I've lived in Middelburg my whole life and so far I've got no plans of going anywhere else because I like how relaxed this city is compared to the bigger cities in the rest of The Netherlands.
            My mother is from Indonesia and my father is from Aruba and they met eachother while studying in Rotterdam. My father went back to Aruba 6 years ago and I still have daily contact with him and I visit him during the summer vacations.
            After I was done with school I took a break from studying and started working. I planned to work for only 1 year but it turned out to be 3 years because I actually quite enjoyed not having to study and making some good money by working. I worked around 40 hours a week which is about the same amount of hours I'll be spending on school work this year.
            So besides working I really didn't do that much other stuff. Just hang out with friends on my off days and sit at home playing videogames or watching Netflix. I like to play osu! with friends, it's a game where you click on circles to the rhythm of the music. Sounds pretty easy but it's quite hard! I also play League of Legends every now and then
            when my friends ask me to join. I also really like One Piece which is a manga about pirates. I've been reading it for 5 years and I'll keep reading it till it finishes in the next couple of years. Below I'll put a few lists with general information about what I like and what I don't like.</p>
        
            <h2>Places I have worked at</h2>  
            <p> I've worked at the Carrousel and Cue Action in Vlissingen for 2 years.
            The Carrousel and the Cue Action are owned by the same owners so I worked at both places. Now what are these places I used to work at? Firstly you had the Carrousel which is sort of an indoor fair where you can play games and earn tickets which you can exhange for prizes at the ticket booth.
            10 years ago it was the most popular hangout spot in Vlissingen, but that has changed over the course of time.. It's still a great place to have a fun time with your friends and family and if you're ever in Vlissingen I'd recommend you pay a visit to the Carrousel! If you're looking for more information about the Carrousel
            just click <a href="https://funhousevlissingen.nl/">here</a> or on the image below to be transported to the official site.</p>
            <p>Now the other branch I worked at is the Cue Action which is a pool and snooker bar. If it isn't obvious enough you can play a game of pool or snooker here, or just have a good time at the bar with a drink or two. There are also two dart boards and you can also order some food here!
                Working here feels a lot different because it's not aimed at children and teenagers like the Carrousel is. Instead the people that come here are mostly adults but as a young adolescent you can definitely have a good time here too! If you want to know more about this place you can click <a href="https://cueaction.nl/">here</a> or on the other picture at the bottom to be redirected to the Cue Action website.</p>
