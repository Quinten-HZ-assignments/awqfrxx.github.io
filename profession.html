        <h3>The 5 different types of ICT organizations:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Yahoo (Webservice provider)</li>
            <li>Blockport (Cryptocurrency company)</li>
            <li>Servicenow (Company that develops a cloud computing platform to improve digital workflow : AGILE!)</li>
            <li>ASML (Semiconductor industry)</li>
            <li>Nintendo (Videogame publishing company)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Servicenow</h4>
        <img src="https://officesnapshots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/servicenow-offices-london-6-1200x800.jpg"
            style = "width: 400px; height: 300px; border-color: black; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-radius: 30%;">

        <p>Servicenow is a sofware company that develops a cloud computing platform to help companies improve their digital workflow.
            In 2019 the company was listed as one of the employers where people wanted to work. Their company is really diverse, they 
            all their employees to actively take part in all the discussions and they treat everyone with respect. They try to create
            a culture based on trust where everyones opinion is heard. They have a ton of jobs at their company. You could go into sales
            or product professionalism, marketing, human resources, techinal support or engineering or business strategy. Their customers
            are really important to them so they invest a lot of recources into it.
        </p>

        <h4>Nintendo</h4>
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/02/99/0f/02990f1679d6b93c995f993ddfda953c.jpg"
            style = "width: 400px; height: 300px; border-color: black; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-radius: 30%;">

        <p>Nintendo is a videogame publishing company. I've read some reviews about working at Nintendo and I get mixed reactions.
            Some people really think it's a great company and love to work there while others do not think that. Apperently it's 
            really hard to grow and progress internally in the company. Some people do get the oppertunity to travel internationally
            and work with people all over the world. They think the people are friendly and the management is great. So the opinions
            really differ and it's always hard to judge a work culture if you don't work there. You can apply for mostly game development
            and software development which makes sense but every company has jobs like marketing, localization and web development. I think
            it would be a great company to start out your career.
        </p>

        <h4>ASML</h4>
        <img src ="https://media.glassdoor.com/l/a1/8a/09/48/bright-and-open-office.jpg"
            style = "width: 400px; height: 300px; border-color: black; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-radius: 30%;">

        <p>ASML is currently the largest supplier in the world of photolithography systems for the semiconductor industry. They are based
            in The Netherlands. The company recieves a lot of praise and awards such as one of the best companies to work at in 2020 and the
            most caring companies of 2020. This already shows that they're greatly respected and I've read a lot of good reviews on ASML. ASML
            always wants to push their technology further. Wether you are a student or experienced engineer, you can work at ASML. You can
            design or build, work with customers or software. The reason why they can always push their technology to the limit is because
            they say they recruit the most creative minds in physics, electronics, mechatronics, software, precision engineering, and many other
            disciplines. If you work at ASML you'll be interacting with all these different kinds of  disciplines. And you can learn from all of
            them. I did read some reviews that management and communication within the company is absolutely catastrophic. I think every big company
            gets good and bad reviews. That's just normal and it's impossible to be perfect and only have good reviews.
        </p>

        <h4>Blockport</h4>
        <img src="https://siliconcanals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Blockport-Office.png"
            style = "width: 400px; height: 300px; border-color: black; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-radius: 30%;">

        <p>Blockport has a mobile and desktop trading application on which users can buy, trade, and sell cryptocurrenices for Euros.
            Blockport rewards experienced traders who share their knowledge and skills in the field with Blockport tokens, which is a 
            form of cryptocurrency. So the company stimulates sharong information and knowledge between the users. There's not much
            information about this topic and Blockport sets out the lessen the gap between longtime users and newcomers. While it's a
            new company they try to grow in a field where there's not much competition yet. So the technology they use is limited.
            I couldn't find any reviews for working at Blockport which might be because it's still a small and upcoming company.
        </p>

        <h4>Yahoo</h4>
        <img src="https://media.glassdoor.com/l/fa/17/0d/f0/building-e-cafeteria.jpg" style = "width: 400px; border-color: black; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-radius: 30%;">
        <img src="https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2016/10/17/inside-yahoo-fantasy-sports-mission-control-body-image-1476725360.jpg"
        style = "width: 400px; height: 300px; border-color: black; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-radius: 30%;">
        <p>Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early internet era in the 1990's. Yahoo employees are expected to work long hours, 
            and in return, the company offers a lot of on-site perks such as more paid vacation, health care, dental insurance and much more.
            As long as you work hard and work a lot of hours you will get a lot of benefits. The company wants people to work in teams and they
            also have stuff like football-tables and games in their cantine. They also have alot of company events which means they value
            teamwork a lot. It sounds like your job becomes part of your social life at Yahoo, so I assume you also need to enjoy your job
            in your freetime. Jobs at Yahoo are mostly technical ones such as: software engineer or webdeveloper. They also have applications
            for database and system administrator or just the usual web developer.
        </p>

        <h3>My opinion and view on the job</h3>
        <p>I think the most important thing I learned from doing some deskresearch about different IT companies is that no matter where u go,
        you'll always have to adapt to their work style. I think every company exepects you to work in teams and be flexible. You must be
        agile! They can provide you with benefits if you work hard though and give you room to grow as a person. But stil, the most important
        skill is the teambuilding and being able to communicare and learn from your colleagues.

        <h4>Macaw, Yoursurprise and VeraCode</h4>
        <p>
            So let's start with Macaw! Macaw is an information technology and services company.
            They have what they call a people-oriented culture which means they care and give attention to 
            their employees, their development, vitality and workbalance. Macaw does a lot of Digital Marketing aswell.
            Macaw's slogan is: Challenge accepted. What they mean by that is they're only satisfied when what they made or crated actually helped
            their clients grow as a company. They basically take responsibility for their work. They have a lot of fre
        </p>

        <p>
            Yoursurprise was the most interesting presentation for me hence why I wrote the most notes on this company.
            Yoursurprise is a company that creates personalized gifts and sends them to their customers. Since 80% of their website
            users visit through mobile they have to make sure the site is optimalized for mobile users. They have websites in 
            22 different countries! They say that sofware is the heart of the company. They even used machine learning models to
            predict their growth and sales in the next year. Everything in their company is code, even the platform.
            They also ordered a new packaging machine that can package the gifts they make really fast. It'll be more efficient 
            than letting employees do it.
            It's a young and dynamic company (300 people), and apparently they're not really good at defining roles.
            Because if you give people one role they only do that one thing, and at Yoursurprise they don't want that. They want
            everyone to do what they want and are good at.
            In their office they have a gym and they can slide the slide in their canteen.
            At Yoursurprise they believe that you need to understand eachothers work to grow as a company which is why all departments
            are in one building and everyone works together.
            The work culture is very open and social/communicative. They have group meetings every week. In real life or currently online.
            As you can see in this company they also value teambuilding a lot. Which is something you definitely need to have under control.
        </p>

        <p>
            CodeVera is an application security company. Their work culture is that everyone who works ar CodeVera has a "hacker" mindset
            on how to create things. Most of them are remote. They do a hackathon twice a year which means they basically do IT related things
            outside of their comfort zone together. Their way of working is also more European than American because they are really flexible.
            Employees have a lot of freedom which is what they like. They can work from home if they can and want to.
            They combine development with hacker stuff to help their customers. They recognize the app and then follow through and check the 
            data if it's good and protected.
        </p>
